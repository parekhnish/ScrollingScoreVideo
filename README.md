# ScrollingScoreVideo

A program to create a scrolling video of a music score PDF, in time with music.

Although there are some automatic scripts, this repository houses a set of TOOLS to be used to create such videos. It is intended as a helper, not a one-stop-shop for a quick video-making experience.

**NOTE**: This is very much still a work in progress! Lots of work to be ccommitted!
